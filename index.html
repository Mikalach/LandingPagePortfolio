	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>We are developing a video game that incorporates mechanics inspired by popular titles such as Mega Man and Hades and when i say i mean I because i am alone. In this game, players will embark on an exciting adventure with a unique blend of platforming and action. The storyline progresses through a level-based system, allowing players to choose their desired path and face challenging bosses along the way.</p>
	<p>Similar to Mega Man, defeating bosses will grant players new abilities or powers that they can use to overcome obstacles and access previously inaccessible areas. These acquired powers will enhance the player's capabilities and introduce new strategic options for navigating the game world.</p>
	<p>To add a roguelite twist, the game features elements inspired by Hades. With each playthrough, players will have the opportunity to upgrade their character's abilities, weapons, and resources. As they progress through the game, the difficulty level will increase, presenting new challenges and opportunities. Depending on the choices made and the resources collected during each run, players will encounter various bonuses or malus, impacting their overall experience.</p>
	<p>The combination of Mega Man's level selection and power acquisition system, along with Hades' roguelite mechanics, creates a captivating gameplay experience that offers both nostalgic familiarity and fresh challenges. Get ready to embark on a thrilling adventure filled with platforming, action, and ever-increasing challenges!</p>
